My blog finally has a name ðŸŽ‰. TinkerMachine might seem quite average but believe it or not, it was the result of many hours of toil. Some names were not catchy enough. Others were already taken after a quick Google search. Some sounded great but didn't have the intended meaning. At a certain point, I finally settled on TinkerMachine not because it was the best I could come up with, but realizing that writing content would be a better outlet of my time.

This post will go over how I set up my Netflify site to use a custom *blog* subdomain and Cloudflare as the authoritative DNS service.

## Buy the Domain
My domain registrar (entity that sells you the domain name) of choice was [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) simply because I had already registered a domain there previously. Domains on the *.xyz* TLDs in particular are quite cheap if you are not looking for something professional like *.com*. 

The [MDN Web Docs page on TLD](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/TLD) explains the various terminologies succintly.
> Consider an example Internet address: https://developer.mozilla.org Here org is the **TLD**; mozilla.org is the **second-level domain name**; and developer is a **subdomain name**. All together, these constitute a **fully-qualified domain name**; the addition of https:// makes this a **complete URL**. 

I will be referring to the second-level domain name as the main/root domain name (or even just domain) which is *tinkermachine.xyz* in my case. These are the names that we purchase from domain registrars and the memorable part of the website URL. 

## Cloudflare DNS
After buying the domain, the next step is to add the domain on Cloudflare in order to [manage the DNS functionality](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/get-started/basic-tasks/manage-domains/).

One nifty feature is the automatic scanning and addition of the DNS records for the domain. Make sure the required A record and the CNAME record are created in the process.  

Simply put,  
*A record*: A name that points to an IPv4 address  
*CNAME record*: An alternate name for a domain.

There are many more [DNS records](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/dns-record-types/) but these seem to be the absolute necessary ones to focus on while starting out.

Once done, all you have to do is [add the Cloudflare nameservers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/zone-setups/full-setup/setup/) under the *Nameservers* section on Namecheap. Make sure to set it to *Custom DNS* first.

## Add Custom Domain on Netlify
On the Netlify dashboard, navigate to *Site Settings*, then *Domain Management* and add an entry under *Custom Domains*. Netlify will now prompt with the required CNAME record we would need to add on our DNS service which is Cloudflare in my case.

Netlify also provides it's own [DNS management service](https://docs.netlify.com/domains-https/netlify-dns/) in case you want to manage all the details of the site in one place.  

**Note**  
Make sure to change the *baseURL* setting for the blog in the Hugo `config.toml` file to ensure the links for the blog don't break. 

## Subdomain setup on Cloudflare
This site is hosted on the *blog* subdomain of the main/root domain which is *tinkermachine.xyz*. This can be easily done by adding a CNAME record which Netlify helpfully suggests from the earlier section.

It would look something like this:  
`CNAME  blog  tinkermachine.netlify.app`

where *tinkermachine.netlify.app* is the internal, Netlify generated URL for the blog based on the name I provided for the site.

The tricky bit was to find how to [redirect the root domain to the subdomain](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/get-started/basic-tasks/manage-subdomains/#redirect-root-domain-to-a-subdomain) so that it wouldn't show an ugly error if someone might visit it. 

This was done through the [Bulk Redirects](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/bulk-redirects/concepts/) functionality on Cloudflare. Here, we set up a rule so that any traffic to the source URL *tinkermachine.xyz*  would be redirected (via an HTTP 301) to the target URL *https://blog.tinkermachine.xyz*.
