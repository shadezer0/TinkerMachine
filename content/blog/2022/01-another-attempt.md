I've always wanted to start writing a blog but that's where it ended as well. The ever-increasing ways to put your content out there paralyzes you from making any real headway into actually writing posts and sharing them. 

Being fascinated with technical design, I've contemplated on numerous ways to publish my thoughts and ideas. The implementation details kept me going around in circles. Should I self-host the blog on a DigitalOcean server? What static site generator should I use? Is using a CMS like [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) an easier option? What about something like the [Bear Blog](https://bearblog.dev/)?
 
So I would start setting up the blog one way and then call it a day after putting up a single post. Then I would learn of a better method, delete the old blog's remnants and set it up a new way. Just figuring out the name alone took more time that I'd care to admit. I just settled on using my GitHub username for now.

What I want to keep in mind on this iteration of my blog: 
- The content can be imperfect. The important fact is to share my thoughts with the public.
- It's okay that I'm not building and self-hosting this blog (fully). I do not have to manage every low-level detail surrounding the setup and upkeep of a personal blog. The GitHub, Netlify approach seems like a good tradeoff between managing the right amount of technical details while still being able to focus on the writing itself.
- Remember that the actual blog posts are more important than how I set the blog up.
- Do not keep procrastinating the writing process by tweaking minor aspects of the blog such as the font and colours. Do not get lost in the implementation details.
