My weekdays usually go by in a blur due to a hectic day job as a DevOps engineer. Something fundamental I realized was that most of the tasks I was getting done that were assigned to me by someone else. Not something that I was setting for myself and checking off. Because I didn't consistently ask myself what *my* goals are and ensure to work on them, it's easy to lose myself in a cycle of fake busy-ness but no real value toward my real goals. 

I like what <cite>James Clear[^1]</cite> has to say about productivity. 

> Productivity is getting important things done consistently. And no matter what you are working on, there are only a few things that are truly important.
>  
> Being productive is about maintaining a steady, average speed on a few things, not maximum speed on everything.

On that vein, I'm setting up my goal achievement system consisting of a 4 step process.

I'm quite certain somebody else would've written about this (or very similar to this) and I'm blatantly ripping them off. But as far as I know, I'm just condensing some info for myself after getting on a productivity high reading James Clear articles.

    1. Seek out goals
    2. Attach habits to goals
    3. Schedule time for habits
    4. Periodic progress review

### Seek out goals
In order to get started on this process, the first step would be to list down your most important goals. Easier said than done, I agree. Ideally you should only jot down 2 or 3 maximum entries. This makes sure our efforts aren't spread out but tightly focussed into key areas that we deem important. Otherwise, the result could be loss of interest over time due to multiple avenues requiring our energy.

Got that list ready? Now we can focus on how to achieve them. These entries would be something like "Get a healthy, fit body" or "Read more books" but make it as specific as possible. Better alternatives would look like - "Get fit in 6 months" or "Read 25 books this year".

Another important thing to keep in mind is to attach a **due date** to the goal. This makes sure that we can keep ourselves motivated and it doesn't just taper out as time goes on.

Now a goal will stagnate and be attached to negative emotions of lack of willpower to achieve these goals unless we do something and take action on it.

### Attach habits to goals
Habits to be attached to your goals - this keeps you consistent.
"Start working out atleast twice a week" or "Read 2 books each month". These can even be scoped down to lower time frames like "Read 2 chapters a day". The important thing is to spend some time and find the habit that would enable you to achieve the goals you set. 

These habits need not be set in stone. As part of the periodic review process in step #4, we can always make corrections to make sure the habits allow us to reach our goals in that particular time frame.

Now these habits need not be something monumental. Take on something that you think would be reasonable. We can set up some time for these habits in the next step.

### Schedule time for your habits
These habits will never happen and will stick to being a reminder on your task management system (big TickTick fan) unless you schedule some regular time for it. Tell yourself that everyday morning, the first thing you do after waking up at 7 is to read 2 chapters of the book you wanted to complete. This allows you to do consistent work to achieve your goals. 

### Periodic progress review
It's easy to get caught up in the progress we're making and completely forget that we're doing the habit to achieve the goal. This is why we would need to schedule regular reviews to introspect on how we've been going about. This would allow us to make course corrections on our trajectory. In case it's reaching towards the end of the year and I still need to finish my books, I could bump up the daily chapter count to 3 instead of 2.

I'm trying to get weekly reviews set up and eventually monthly and yearly reviews of my goals seem like great goals themselves. 

I'm beginning my weekly review practice where each Saturday morning I sit down with a pen and paper and track the progress on my goals. This is to check if I'm going the right direction and putting in the right amount of effort.
