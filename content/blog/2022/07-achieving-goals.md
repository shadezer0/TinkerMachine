My weekdays usually go by in a blur due to a hectic day job as a DevOps engineer. Most of the tasks I was doing were assigned to me by someone else, not something that I was setting for myself and checking off. Without consistently asking myself what *my* goals are and working on them, it's easy to get lost in a cycle of fake busyness. 

I like what <cite>James Clear has to say about productivity[^1]</cite>. 

> Productivity is getting important things done consistently. And no matter what you are working on, there are only a few things that are truly important.
>  
> Being productive is about maintaining a steady, average speed on a few things, not maximum speed on everything.

In that vein, I'm setting up my goal achievement system consisting of a 4 step process.

Somebody else would've certainly written very similar to this and I might be blatantly ripping them off. But as far as I know, I'm just condensing some info for myself after getting on a productivity high reading James Clear articles.

    1. Seek out goals
    2. Attach habits to goals
    3. Schedule time for habits
    4. Periodic progress review

### Seek out goals
In order to get started on this process, the first step is to list down your most important goals. Easier said than done, I agree. Jot down a maximum of 2 or 3 entries. Our efforts need to be tightly focussed into key areas that we deem important. Otherwise, you lose interest over time due to multiple avenues draining your energy. Take as much time as needed here. If the goal isn't right, there's no point in spending time to figure out an optimized approach to get it done.

Got your goals ready? These entries would usually be something like "Get a fit and healthy body" or "Read more books" but make the goal as specific as possible. Better alternatives would look like "Get fit in 6 months" or "Read 25 books this year".

This is a critical task - set a **due date** for the goal. This makes sure that we can stay on track and be motivated to complete the goal. Otherwise, we run the risk of endlessly going about on a habit without any targets to achieve and progress to be tracked.

### Attach habits to goals
Habits need to be attached to your goals - this keeps you working consistently on them.

"Start working out atleast twice a week" or "Read 2 books each month". These can even be scoped down to lower time frames like "Read 2 chapters a day". The important thing is to spend some time and find the habit and frequency that would work for you. Make sure that the habits are realistic and offer meaningful progress without feeling burnt out.

These habits are not set in stone. As part of the periodic review process in step #4, we can always make corrections to make sure the habits allow us to reach our goals in our previously decided time frame.

### Schedule time for your habits
These habits will never happen and will be a reminder on your task management system (check out [TickTick](https://ticktick.com/)) unless you schedule some regular time for it. Tell yourself that everyday morning, the first thing you do after waking up is to read 2 chapters of the book you wanted to complete. This allows you to consistently put time into your habits.

Setting up this time also allows us to not struggle with finding time between the numerous other activities populating our daily life.

### Periodic progress review
It's easy to get caught up in the progress we're making and completely forget that we're doing the habit to achieve our goal. This is why you need to schedule regular reviews to introspect on the progress that's been made. This allows us to make course corrections on our journey if necessary. 

In case it's close to the end of the year and a significant chunk of the reading list is remaining, you could probably bump up the daily chapter count to 3 instead of 2.

Personally, I'm beginning a weekly review practice where each Saturday morning, I sit down with a pen and paper and track the progress on my goals. Monthly and yearly reviews of my goals seem like great goals themselves. 

### Takeaway
This system certainly has areas for refinement, but I'm quite happy with the overall structure that it offers. The important bit is to not blindly start working but to apply some thought into figuring out where you want to direct your energy. The optimizing, scheduling and progress introspection come later when you've got your main goals locked in place.
