+++

One of the most insightful books I've read (and I'm re-reading right now) is Eric Jorgenson's "The Almanack of Naval Ravikant". It's not written in the vein of self help books but a collection of snippets from his experiences and thought process. There's no advising along the lines of "you should do x and y to be 300% faster" but more like "here's what's worked extremely well for me; think about it and see if it works for you".

His thoughts on wealth creation, technology that propels humanity, philosophy and ideas of finding happiness and success are very approachable and digestible. To a point that it feels too easy to read sometimes without giving it the required amount of time to truly digest what he means. The ideas are boiled down to their very core essence and you need to take time to sit and mull over his arguments to know why and how you can incorporate some of those strategies to your own life.

The first time I read through the book, I almost did it cover to cover and didn't completely grasp the full value of the ideas being brought up. Now, I'm picking up smaller sections to dive into and ponder. To see how I can bring value to my life and design actionable goals based on what I read. There is a lot of value in finding a small nugget of an idea from books, articles and experiences and then to refine it and write it down in a way that you can use it as a mental model for later in life.

Some big takeaways I'm getting over the multiple times I've gone through this book:

### Managing Desires
- Managing desires is key to finding happiness in whichever stage of life you're in. Pick a big one and focus on that. Eliminate the other ones that just become fuel for discontentment. 

> Desire is a contract you make with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want.

### Exercise
- Naval talks about exercise as "the habit that most positively impacts his life". I've only managed to have an inconsistent exercise routine over the years and never at a stage where I could see growth. The occasional run and a couple of push-ups here and there. 

- The daily morning workout is something I'm deeply considering to do. The fact that it's taking place in the morning means:
  1. I get to do it first thing after waking up giving me a rush of energy and positive thoughts for the rest of the day.
  2. I don't need to struggle to find time later on in the busier parts of the day.

> What I did was decide my number one priority in life, above my hapiness, above my family, above my work, is my own health. It starts with my phyiscal health.

### Doing Nothing
- The power of doing nothing. It's incredibly hard to give yourself time consistently to sit and do absolutely nothing. Just letting the thoughts flow and freeing yourself from the constant back and forth that's happening up in your mind. 
- Naval advocates to meditate for atleast an hour in the morning because "anything less is not enough time to really get deep into it". Although I certainly agree, maybe it makes sense to start off small and have a consistent 10 minutes in the morning to practice meditation. This is also a core idea behind the blog itself where I can sort through and distill some of my thoughts after these "nothing" sessions.

> It's only after you're bored you have the great ideas. It's never going to be when you're stressed, or busy, running around or rushed. Make the time.

### Final Thoughts
There are certainly numerous "big ideas" to chew on after going through this book. But it doesn't make sense to pick them up all at once and try to think about them. Pick a small subset. Really take your time and think about whether they actually bring value to you and how you could start implementing it in your life.

I haven't even brought up the insights he makes in the first part of the book on wealth creation. I've been fascinated on re-reading the second part which talks about finding happiness and incorporating practices to take care of yourself. 

Hoping to write more posts about this book in the near future.
