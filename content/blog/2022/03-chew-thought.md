As a kid sitting through long service hours at church on a Sunday morning, I had a trick to keep myself entertained. At the time, Pokemon Emerald was my primary obsession. I used to visualize possible strategies to beat gym leaders, ways to catch some elusive pokemon or the best Pokemon roster I could battle with. This allowed me to keep my mind occupied because of course I didn't think paying attention to the church service was a viable option. 

This is a concept I'm now naming **Chew Thought**â„¢. A thought for your mind to chew on in situations where you are bored. The application of the idea is more interesting than the name, I promise. 

These days, at the onset of feeling fidgety and bored, you pick up your phone, open your social media platform of choice and start mindlessly scrolling. Waiting in line, sitting on the toilet, going down an elevator - all these situations nudge us towards our constant digital companions. But what if you could carry around a chew thought instead? 

It could be that problem you were tackling at work for the past few days or some way to beat a video game boss. Maybe that interesting idea you heard about in a podcast or even the next post for your brand new blog. 

Whatever it may be, set your mind loose on that thought and it'll be more productive than doom-scrolling. Instead of the internet telling you what to focus on through its endless feeds, wouldn't it be better to take the initiative and think about something that you decide to place value on?

Maybe zoning out on your thoughts isn't very new but the fact that you can actively carry one around to zone out on, is definitely new for me.

I do want to point out that in social situations, interaction and conversation are better than spacing out in a corner somewhere. As hard as it might seem (for me atleast), talking to other people has its benefits too. My trick still applies when it's not a social gathering and you're standing in line at the grocery store. Be careful not to get *completely* lost in your thoughts though.

This idea may not be revolutionary but for most people instinctively reaching out for their phones whenever boredom strikes, it would be a better option to reach out to that thought/idea you have stowed away instead.
