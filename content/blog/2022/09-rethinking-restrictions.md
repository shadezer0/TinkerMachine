Restrictions are seen negatively and we usually tend to strive for freedom and endless options. In this post, I want to argue for rethinking about restrictions that pop up in our lives as an avenue for growth and creativity. To view the challenges that we face in a better light and reinforce the fact through a variety of examples I've stumbled across via books and digital media.

More specifically, it goes along the lines of the [choice paradox](https://thedecisionlab.com/reference-guide/economics/the-paradox-of-choice) which states that with an increase in choices, there's a decrease in the amount of freedom we experience due to the difficulty of picking one choice over the many others. 

Counterintuitively, the lack of extra choices gives rise to more freedom in the task that we aim to do. To expend our willpower not in choosing what to do but to get further in any particular path.

### Just Get Started by Picking any Direction
In [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6NsEDwHHiE), Struthless advises on how to get started with doing something. In his case where he wanted to get better at drawing, he forced himself to pick an arbitrary topic and started to draw that each day. This eliminates procrastination and the wastage of willpower when trying to decide what to draw.

This process then continues until you get better at the craft to the point where a decision can be made to draw something else. At that stage, you wouldn't need to spend time deciding but the ideas would come naturally due to the experience gained over time with consistent effort.

### Finding Meaning Through Suffering 
In [Man's Search For Meaning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man%27s_Search_for_Meaning) by Victor Frankl, Dr. Frankl shares the horrific experiences he had to endure while going through Nazi concentration camps at the height of World War 2. He explains in the book that it was through these restrictions in his way of living that he was able to formulate a method to derive meaning through the suffering. 

After his arduous ordeals, he was able to establish the practice of logotherapy where the physician aims to treat patients suffering from mental illnesses by showing them value and purpose in their life by finding their unique meaning in it. 

### Valuing Long Term Commitments
In David Perrel's piece on [hugging the x-axis](https://perell.com/essay/hugging-the-x-axis/), he talks about commitments and restricting ourselves to stick to something for the long-term in order to see real benefits.

He also brings up the value of commitments in a society obsessed with shuffling between options. This happens at the expense of not sticking with anything specific for long enough only after which a unique experience and knowledge in the topic can be formed.

Long term marriages, a long-term career in a particular field, a long-term dedication to a particular cause, all are more beneficial when compared to their short-term counterparts. The real trick is to know when to stop dabbling with choices and to pick one and commit.

### Using Restrictions as a Mechanism for Growth
In the Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas, there's a thought-provoking conversation between Abbé (French word for priest) Faria and Dante, who are inmates in the dungeons of the Chateau d'If. It goes to show how we can find growth and progress not in-spite of captivity (of the mind and body) but because of it. 

Dantes, after basking in Faria's intelligence and creative work on entering the latter's chamber, poses a question on the possible achievements Faria could have attained if he were free. Here is Faria's response:

> "Possibly nothing at all; the overflow of my brain would probably, in a state of freedom, have evaporated in a thousand follies; misfortune is needed to bring to light the treasures of the human intellect. Compression is needed to explode gunpowder. Captivity has brought my mental faculties to a focus; and you are well aware that from the from the collision of clouds electricity is produced - from electricity, lightning, from lightning, illumination."
>> Ch 17 - The Abbé's Chambers, Pg 142

## Actionable Takeaways
Embrace the challenges and difficulties of life and endeavour to find creative solutions which hone your skills and nourish your experiences. Place useful restrictions in situations where there's an abundance of choice preventing you from making real progress.

- Read a book first thing after waking up. Placing this restriction reduces the cognitive load to find time to read during the day.  
- Ask myself what application/service I use most often and try to self-host that instead of delving through numerous available options on GitHub.
- View sudden changes cropping up in life positively as a way to shake up existing conditions and plan for improvements.
- Implement a restriction that you won't look at a screen for the first hour after waking up and the last hour before going to bed.
