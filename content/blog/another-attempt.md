 I've always wanted to start writing a blog but that's where it always ended as well. The ever-increasing ways to put your content out there paralyzes you from making any real headway into actually writing posts and sharing them. Being fascinated with technical design, I've contemplated on numerous ways to publish my thoughts and ideas. But it always stopped at the first post and then deletion of that entire setup the next time I was trying out some new way to generate my blog. Just figuring out the name alone was driving me insane when I just settled on using my GitHub username.

 So instead of focussing on the technical details too much this time, let me focus on the (probably sloppy) writing. 

This time around I want it to be different.
- The content can be imperfect. The important fact is to put it out there on the internet.
- I don't have to design and manage every single aspect of the blog. It's okay that I'm not building and self-hosting this blog.
- What's not okay is me not consistently writing content irrespective of how I set the blog up.
