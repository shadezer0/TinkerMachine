# Welcome to my Blog!

Hi, I'm Ashley and I'm hoping to document my thoughts, ideas and personal projects in this tiny corner of the internet.

I love to work on self-hosting and automation. I've only started out with the PiHole but the journey has only begun. I've recently set up a small home-server with the intent to host some of the cloud applications I use daily.  

I like to sit still in quiet contemplation and take a small moment to simmer in my thoughts. It doesn't always happen but when it does, I get some good insight that I'd like to jot down for later.

This small site is made using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and uses the [hugo-bearblog](https://github.com/janraasch/hugo-bearblog/) theme which in turn was inspired by the wonderful [ʕ•ᴥ•ʔ Bear Blog](https://bearblog.dev/). 

The contents of this blog can be found over at this [GitHub repo](https://github.com/shadezer0/shadezero). The build and deploy process for the resources on my GitHub page is done with the help of [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
